Wordle Result is a simple app to help you store your Wordle or Nerdle game results history.

Just copy and paste the sharing text from the game, enter the word, and the date. The app can infer more data from the sharing text itself, like game number, tries, and the result emojis.

The app is currently deployed to Google Firebase: https://wordle-results.web.app

Example of a Wordle / Nerdle sharing text:

```
Wordle 216 4/6

⬛⬛⬛🟨⬛
🟨🟩🟩⬛🟨
🟩🟩🟩🟩⬛
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩

Nerdle 14 4/6

⬛️🟪⬛️🟪🟪🟪🟪⬛️
🟩⬛️🟩🟪🟪🟪⬛️🟩
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟪🟩🟪
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
```

You can also view some useful statistics based on the results data, like the number of games played, wins percentage, and the tries distribution.

This app is not affiliated with Wordle or Nerdle in any form, it's an independent tool created by a fan of those games.
